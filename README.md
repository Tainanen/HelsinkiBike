### What does this application do?
***
This Helsinki City Bike application is based on the data from the Helsinki City Bike trips and stations during summer 2021. This application enables users to list, sort and search for the trips and stations as well as find detailed information about the stations. For example, it's possible to find out, what was the longest trip made or the most popular station used during summer 2021 :) This is Solita's pre-assignment exercise 2023.

### Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:

* [JDK](https://openjdk.org/): Version 17
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/): Version 3.0.6
* [MySQL](https://mysql.com): Version 8.0.32
* [React](https://react.dev/): Version 18.0.2
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Version 6.11.1
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Version 18.14.1
* [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/): For importing the large csv.files and mapping them correctly
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): For testing and interacting with backend endpoints and validating the API functionality.
* [Docker](https://docker.com): For packaging and running the application in containers.
* [GCP](https://console.cloud.google.com/): For building and deploying the application on the cloud.

This application was made on Windows 11.
The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, with JDK 17. It utilizes MySQL as the database for data storage.
The frontend of the application is built using React and utilizes React Router for routing functionality. Node.js is required as a prerequisite for development and building the React application.

### Installation and running the application
***
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend using the package manager of your choice (for example Maven).
4. Configure the database connection in the application properties file located in the backend directory.
5. Run the project using the provided "build" command.
6. Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend using the package manager of your choice (for example NPM).
7. Run the frontend development server.
8. The application will run in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

### Database
***
1. First, I created the database "bikes" and added 2 tables on it:

2. After creating the tables, I imported the datasets - that contain information about the journeys (in my database journeys are called trips) and stations - from these files into the database using TablePlus. I changed the names of some of the csv-files columns to match them with my database tables. I also omitted "FID" (autogenerated id) from the stations file and used a separate id field "ID" instead.

* https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/726277c507ef4914b0aec3cbcfcbfafc_0.csv

3. I did cleaning and updating of the data in MySQL client by running these queries: 

* DELETE FROM trips WHERE distance_m is < 10;
* DELETE FROM trips WHERE duration_s is < 10;
* DELETE FROM from trips WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM trips GROUP BY departure, `return`, departure_station_id, departure_station_name, return_station_id, return_station_name, distance_m, duration_s HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
* UPDATE stations SET city_fin = "Helsinki" WHERE city_fin is null;
* UPDATE stations SET city_swe = "Helsingfors" WHERE city_swe is null;

### Features
***
These features can be found from my application:
1. Journey list view
* Lists the journeys and shows their departure and return stations, their covered distance in kilometers, and their duration in minutes
* Pagination, ordering per column
2. Station list
* Lists all the stations
* Pagination, searching, links to the single station view
3. Single station view
* Shows the station name, station address, total number of journeys starting from the station, total number of journeys ending at the station, the average distance of a journey starting from the station, the average distance of a journey ending at the station, top 5 most popular return stations for journeys starting from the station, and top 5 most popular departure stations for journeys ending at the station
4. Endpoints to store data on new journeys or new bicycle stations
* It is possible to create, update and remove journeys and stations

### Running the whole application in Docker
***
![Docker-image](frontend-react/src/images/Screenshot_2023-05-29_120106.png)

This is how I did it (this explanation does not include spesific intructions on how to do this):
1. I downloaded Docker  (https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and installed it.
2. I started Docker Service (I used Docker Desktop, and it needs to be running when building and running containers).
3. For the database, I created MySQL Docker Container by pulling the latest MySQL Docker image and running it.
4. I exported the database as a SQL dump using MySQL Workbench and then copied it into the MySQL Container. 
5. I packaged my backend Spring Boot application with Maven.
6. I created a Dockerfile in the backend folder and copied the application and defined the image, application port and entrypoint.
7. I created a Dockerfile in the frontend folder the same way I did with the backend Dockerfile, only using a different image, application port and entrypoint.
8. I built and ran the Spring Boot Container. 
9. I built and ran the frontend React Container. 
10. That's it! 
11. This is a very simplified explanation and may contain some mistakes as I'm still trying to learn the secrets of Docker. For more information and guidance, I recommend this page: https://docker-curriculum.com/. Also, you should be prepared to google a lot!

### Running the whole application in GCP
***
![GCP-image](frontend-react/src/images/GCP_running_application.png)

This is how I did it (this explanation does not include spesific intructions on how to do this):
1. First, I set up a GCP account here: https://cloud.google.com/.
2. Then I set up a Cloud SQL instance and imported my bike database there. I used the SQL dump to export from MySQL Workbench while making Docker database. I also set a new user and password for the instance.
3. Then I changed the backend's application properties to include the cloud-sql-database instance connection name and database name as well as username and password. In my pom.xml, I added these dependencies: spring-cloud-gcp-dependencies & spring-cloud-gcp-starter-sql-mysql. 
4. Then I made a new Java JAR, built a new backend image and tagged and pushed it into GCP Artifact Registry. I followed these instructions: https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/pushing-and-pulling 
5. After the backend image was in the Artifact Registry, I opened Cloud Run, created new service and used the image I just pushed to the registry. 
6. For my frontend I made changes to the url's I was using, so instead of localhost:8080, it now uses the url of the backend Cloud Run service. 
7. Then I built the frontend image and tagged and pushed also that one to the Artifact Registry. After this, I started a new Cloud Run service using that image.
8. That's it! Now I can see the application running in the frontend url and I have sent the address to everyone I know so they can see the application that I have created :)
9. Again, this is a highly simplified guide, and it probably includes some mistakes. You can read about the basics of GCP, for example, in here: https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview

### Reflections and what next?
***
This was the first ever application that I made by myself and I'm proud of it! Overall, this application took less than 3 weeks to complete and all its main functionalities work. I'm also happy that I was able to dockerize the whole application and deploy it on the cloud. In terms of what I would do differently next time, I would spend more time thinking about the structure of the application. In addition to this, using term "trip" instead of "journey" was a silly mistake that I noticed too late. It would also be interesting to use Java instead of MySQL Workbench to programmatically define the table structure and read the data files for the database. If I had more time, I also would have added webpages for creating, updating and deleting the stations and journeys - the endpoints are already there to make this possible :)

##### I'd still like to learn more about:
* Testing: The tiny Mockito-tests that I am currently using are the simplest tests there are. I have plenty to learn on this field. 
* Frontend: This is my first time doing something with React and I can say I learned a lot about the structure and basic functions. However, the webpage does not yet have all the functionality (and the nice appearance) that it should include.
* Databases: I'm most familiar with MySQL, but I'd like to try, for example, MongoDB or PostgreSQL in a similar exercise. I'd also like to learn more about planning and designing an excellent database. 
* Mobile version: As of yet, I don't know how to make this application work in a mobile environment, but that's also something I'd like to learn.
