### What does this application do?
***
This Helsinki City Bike application is based on the data of the Helsinki City Bike trips and stations on summer 2021. Users and list, sort and search for the trips and stations as well as find detailed information about the stations. For example it's possible to find out, which was the longest trip made or the most popular station in the summer 2021 :)

### Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:

* [JDK](https://openjdk.org/): Version 17
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/): Version 3.0.6
* [MySQL](https://mysql.com): Version 8.0.32
* [React](https://react.dev/): Version 18.0.2
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Version 6.11.1
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Version 18.14.1
* [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/): For importing big csv.files and mapping them correctly
* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): For testing and interacting with backend endpoints and validating API functionality.

This application was made on Windows 11.
The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, with JDK 17. It utilizes MySQL as the database for data storage.
The frontend of the application is built using React and utilizes React Router for routing functionality. Node.js is required as a prerequisite for development and building the React application.

### Installation and running the application
***
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend using the package manager of your choice (for example Maven).
4. Configure the database connection in the application properties file located in the backend directory.
5. Run the project using the provided build command.
6. Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend using the package manager of your choice (for example NPM).
7. Run the frontend development server.
8. The application will run in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

### Database
***
1. First I created the database "bikes" and added 2 tables on it:

2. After creating the tables, I imported the datasets about trips and stations from these files into the database using TablePlus. I changed the names of some of the csv-files columns to match them with my database tables. I also omitted "FID" (autogenerated id) from the stations file and used a separate id field "ID" instead.

3. I did cleaning and updating of the data in MySQL client by running these queries: 

* DELETE FROM trips WHERE distance_m is < 10;
* DELETE FROM trips WHERE duration_s is < 10;
* DELETE FROM from trips WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM trips GROUP BY departure, `return`, departure_station_id, departure_station_name, return_station_id, return_station_name, distance_m, duration_s HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
* update stations set city_fin = "Helsinki" where city_fin is null;
* update stations set city_swe = "Helsingfors" where city_swe is null;
